Course reflection,"I wished to watch a """"funny"""" story on Flourish or Inzight ,which are main elements of this course.Tableu is nowhere in the course."
Course reflection,The course has been fun and the learnings about best ways of exploring data with overview storytelling is what I was trying to put in practice.
Unconventional emotion expression,This is cool!This confirms my personal impression that people don’t make music as good as they used to :)
Unconventional emotion expression,Niiice tool!
Unconventional emotion expression,"But like the poster noted, colours and all that come next :)"
Unconventional emotion expression,Hi!That is a GREAT topic! :)
Unconventional emotion expression,I just made a quick draft for fun :)
Unconventional emotion expression,so sorry! O:)
Unconventional emotion expression,My 2 cents :)
Unconventional emotion expression,"To be honest, I didn’t expect this to be so frustrating at times :)"
Unconventional emotion expression,it could become their higher level strategy to attract more tourists : ]
Unconventional emotion expression,I’m from France :)
Unconventional emotion expression,Great job though! :)
Unconventional emotion expression,"see this link for the """"raw"""" template). :-)"
Unconventional emotion expression,Envious of your skillset for compelling & easy to read data. : )
Unconventional emotion expression,but in my imagination dogs and mices are friends :)
Unconventional emotion expression,"that’s very tasty, too... ;-)"
Unconventional emotion expression,"Annabelle, your story made me smile :-)"
Unconventional emotion expression,"Hi Takura,WOW."
Unconventional emotion expression,"Otherwise, great job! :)"
Unconventional emotion expression,The possibilities are endless... :-)
Unconventional emotion expression,As for Nollywood :-)
Unconventional emotion expression,A comparison with North America will be wonderful too ;-)
Unconventional emotion expression,Hope this helps :-)
Unconventional emotion expression,"And not just because my favourite club, Manchester City, was so well represented in the 2018 World Cup. ;-)"
Unconventional emotion expression,Some suggestions from my side:- your viz deserves a title! :-D
Unconventional emotion expression,Thanks for your feedback :D

Quoting from others' messages & Referring explicitly to others' messages,I would like to second Rahel’s comment: do you have any ideas which factors influence the trends in employment?
Quoting from others' messages & Referring explicitly to others' messages,"To consider someone to be literate, I found that different countries use different means. (https://ourworldindata.org/how-is-literacy-measured)"
Expressing disagreement,I have a suspicion your data can change significantly.
Expressing disagreement,I was not sure what you used as your data source.
Expressing disagreement,I still think it is unlikely that disease is causing the population decline
Expressing disagreement,I did find it confusing though that you used the same color palette to for the boroughs in the map as you did for the races in the stacked bar.
Expressing disagreement,I was also concerned about the colors repeating for different purposes.
Expressing disagreement,I’m not sure of the value of looking at the demographic breakdown in the boroughs and how it relates to SAT scores.
Expressing disagreement,"However, I do not agree with you that the energy use in Asia is particular high."
Expressing disagreement,Not a good idea to have vertical scroll in an interactive infographic
Expressing disagreement,I don’t really agree with the chart option you gave because it looks like a scatterplot without being one which can be confusing
Expressing disagreement,I wonder if using red for the whole visualisation was the right choice.
Expressing disagreement,But... but there’s a problem.you have not thought about other risks for the little mouse.
Expressing disagreement,"Not sure if rank adds extra information, since audience can detect rank from scoring as well."
Expressing disagreement,I just wondering if you really need all the graphs.
Expressing disagreement,"I have some doubts about the numbers, those for the different ages seem much too high to me."
Expressing disagreement,I am not sure if average of an index is the best way to show the data although I can see how it could show places with a tendency for being less or more explosive.
Personal advice,I see that you started at 70s. Have you think about to separate analysis by decades?
Personal advice,"Some litle suggestions:- Maybe, you could complete your dataset with the kind of music"
Personal advice,It would be interesting to know if the cause of death is also related to the kind of music of the artist
Personal advice,"You could take advantage of the Location data to analize the """"Unlucky 27"""" theory. It would be interesting to know if it was a repeated event per location"
Personal advice,"Other things that come to mind are solo artist versus band member, geographic distribution, career trajectory to name a few.Please share the dataset you’ve compiled"
Personal advice,Just one thought comes to mind in terms of opportunities to improve the visualization
Personal advice,"By visualizing deaths of rock musicians versus deaths among the total population, this is something we could understand visually."
Personal advice,I’d also like to filter by genre if I can figure out how to do it
Personal advice,what would have been really interesting is to see a map of deaths by type stratified by age
Personal advice,"Those dynamics may be hard to measure, but the mass northward migration would be interesting to track over a similar time frame."
Personal advice,I think you could get answers in emigration statistics and political situations in these countries.
Personal advice,I would be interested in the time course
Personal advice,I would also use percentage of growth
Personal advice,"did you consider taking the wide ranges and transforming them by giving them some common denominator, such as population per square meter or mile?"
Personal advice,with these data I would try to go deeper if the minority genders proportionally need more treatment
Personal advice,"It would be interesting to compare with audio streaming services data, I assume the results would be totally different."
Personal advice,It would be interesting to overlay the visual with the average birth year of the Rolling Stone editors/contributorsthat came up with the list.Also would be interesting to compare this list to other magazines/publisher lists.
Personal advice,One other possible thing to explore would be which album in the artist’s discography got ranked
Personal advice,"It would, however, be interesting to see the change in popularity of specific genres over time."
Personal advice,It would be interesting to view by both sales and acclaim to see if there’s any correlation.
Personal advice,"Still a very relevant insight to explore, unfortunately. I think it would be interesting to separate by positions in the hierarchy of the staff, if there was such information"
Personal advice,It would be really cool if you interviewed that teacher. Bring it on.
Personal advice,but I would suggest looking at overall death rates first.
Personal advice,I think that it could be interesting make a comparision between the age of the hospitalized people and its diseases
Personal advice,But here are my thoughts:- I would spell out once what ESL means .
Personal advice,"Also, I understand you want to cut down on excess information but I would appreciate a quick color chart in one of the bottom corners that I can glance at while I am reading your graphs."
Personal advice,It would definitely be worth looking into.
Personal advice,It might be interesting to also use the map districts to filter the scatterplots.
Personal advice,It’d by nice to see where all the schools in my specific district fall.
Personal advice,One criticism: I would work on the color scheme - confusing to have manhattan coded red and also hispanic students coded red.
Personal advice,I think the final portion of your post points to the need for some statistical analysis to gauge the extent to which these two variables are correlated.
Personal advice,I’d be very interested to view a trendline showing the general relationship between CO2 and taxes.
Personal advice,though one suggestion to improve chloropleth maps: if you want to compare them keep the same value bins for each color.
Personal advice,It would be also very interesting to compare this data with deforestation data!
Personal advice,That is the only minor suggestion I have for improving your charts.
Personal advice,"I think what would be interesting to see is how the mix of grains fluctuate, particularly among the top trade partners."
Personal advice,"If possible come and take a look at my work, it can be accessed online dynamically."
Personal advice,"Instead of a stacked bar chart, a normal bar chart could be an alternative."
Personal advice,I think if you used another color for the Western Hemisphere and Western Europe it would be more appealing.
Personal advice,One thing to consider with future predictions is that they is more uncertainty the farther out the prediction such as the year 2050.
Personal advice,I think it might be interesting to show the status on the right
Personal advice,"Maybe, you can focus the data in the operable reactors to see the capacity of this countries to produce energy."
Personal advice,You might want to consider a legend rather than labelling directly
Personal advice,it would be interesting to further follow this data and couple it with interviews of girls from countries where education is expanding.
Personal advice,you can investigate reading the story of Nepal and Lesotho.
Personal advice,"Perhaps, you can find, in this way, some intuitions."
Personal advice,"Perhaps it will be useful to make a scatter chart, in x-axis the percentage of girls and in y-axis the country income."
Personal advice,"Hi Claudia,If you go tohttps://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SE.PRM.CMPT.FE.ZS?view=chart, you’ll find a spot where you can download the dataset in CSV, Excel, or XML."
Personal advice,It might help to add some numerical ranges to the y-axis to better understand what is being classified as what kind of income.
Personal advice,A bit of color in the chart might also help add clarity
Personal advice,"maybe having the lines and boxes in a color different from the background would help them stand out visually, making the data easier to grasp quicker"
Personal advice,"First, you need a decompressor (I have iZip). Then you still have the tsv file. Then you can choose to transform it through R"
Personal advice,The second option is to google a converter from tsv to csv.
Personal advice,It would be interesting to use a map of Florida to clearly show where the bites were
Personal advice,you could color them to depict resident/non-resident victims
Personal advice,I would add also that such a map could be improved if made interactive
Personal advice,This may help us to identify some seasonal patterns
Personal advice,Another idea would be to use the data to help people avoid bites in the future.
Personal advice,Perhaps you might want to use color on one map - the one of the winning side
Personal advice,This would allow you to see changes in staffing over time.
Personal advice,"If you wanted to show how expenditure relates to staffing, then expenditure could be on the X"
Personal advice,The points could have been labelled by years
Personal advice,I think you could have improved your graphic
Personal advice,It would be great if you could take a look at this new graph:https://journalismcourses.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=104639#p293579
Personal advice,Try choosing a visualization with a single pair of axes
Personal advice,"If you need to do so, it might be better to limit each type of encoding (bars or lines) to a single axis."
Personal advice,Would be interesting to see what you find with some more digging in the data!
Personal advice,It would be great to do some follow-up interviews to find out what the reasons for these trends are.
Personal advice,Your charts could be clearer
Personal advice,It might also be good to focus on the extremes like the Netherlands vs Honduras.
Personal advice,"You could use different colors for different years, but keep the same color for a given year across all countries"
Personal advice,Another possibility if the data is available would be to look by country.
Personal advice,I would make the headline bigger and bolder with possibly some colour in it.
Personal advice,perhaps it would serve the visualisation better to use a world map?
Personal advice,you might want to look at your selection of colour hues and shades.
Personal advice,Some feedback:
Personal advice,I think it would be better to leave each country in the same position on the x axis
Personal advice,Having the bars staggered by their amounts would also help compare countries.
Personal advice,Just two minor nitpicks/questions:
Personal advice,how about a scatter plot?
Personal advice,still maybe you give the happy floating bubbles a try?
Personal advice,The scatterplot would be a great idea
Personal advice,"Some details in graphics, such as many colours instead put the names into the graph could be better."
Personal advice,I still wonder if it could be larger?
Personal advice,Could the text at the top be larger and summarized?
Personal advice,My only wish would be to see if I could do more comparisons against even more nations.
Personal advice,you could use interesting annotations to provide further insights and make it more interesting.
Personal advice,"Not to be conspiratorial, but it might be interesting to follow the campaign trails in conjunction with the shootings."
Personal advice,"I think the interactive could be complemented with other graphics and variables to try to find a correlation such as education, poverty, number of guns by region..."
Personal advice,That would be a great story to tell.
Personal advice,but maybe something to consider (if the feature is available) would be to pause at some points to highlight specific incidents.
Personal advice,I think that particular component could be implemented more effectively
Personal advice,One thing which could be interesting would be to gradually change the color of the region of the map
Personal advice,If you were to continue I would suggest making a research about arm sales and regions where they are more easy to get and explore what the links could be.
Personal advice,Just two comments.
Personal advice,That would be cool.
Personal advice,You have to do another bubble charts
Personal advice,if I may suggest an improvement there is a visible data gap in Switzerland.
Personal advice,I believe you could develop such a narrative a bit further
Personal advice,Some little suggestions
Personal advice,The one thing I would change is to add a note to the Chapter 3 heat map telling the reader that a low overall score is the most desirable.
Personal advice,"If I had to make a critique, it will be on resources breakdown"
Personal advice,It is good to see more details on this.
Personal advice,i wish you could go deeper and show the impact on Afghanistan
Personal advice,"I wonder if it was easy for you to select the information, it seems there are a lot of data about it."
Personal advice,It would be nice to add photos of number one goods imported from each country
Personal advice,The only suggestion I have to offer is that you may want to rethink the use of the Sankey diagram
Personal advice,My only feedback is on the doughnut chart.
Personal advice,maybe switch to a bar chart?
Personal advice,"It would be cleaner, and easier to see."
Personal advice,One additional thing I think might be rather interesting to see would be the relation between the absolute number of tickets sold and the size of the population
Personal advice,It will be interesting to explore how the density of multiplex screens has increased as they say India is the most under-screened country
Personal advice,My only thought is that you could tell us in the first slide
Personal advice,The only thing I was wondering about is slide no. 4.
Personal advice,I’d have probably added a budget/movie comparison across countries as well
Personal advice,The only hiccup seemed to be slide 4
Personal advice,Wondering if a slide could be added on highest paid actors
Personal advice,"If I had to make a critique, I will consider ordering countries in terms of wich percentage of allways happy is bigger."
Personal advice,"My suggestion is to order the countries alphabetically, this will help"
Personal advice,the audience to find the countries easier.
Personal advice,"The only criticism I could make (but that I don’t know how to fix either, is that in the first slide, it’s difficult to discern trends."
Personal advice,Maybe if the graphs were plotted onto a map of Europe one could more easily see the trend
Personal advice,It would be nice to combine for example climate
Personal advice,Some totals for all of Europe would also be nice as reference
Personal advice,The only minor change I would make to your presentation would be to use the same color
Personal advice,One thing I would suggest:
Personal advice,"instead of looking at each individual level of happiness across each country individually, perhaps you could look at each level of happiness together in one line chart"
Personal advice,It will be perfect if you will have an ability to choose 2 countries
Personal advice,My only suggestion is that it is better to write the explanations of the information on the head of the slide after the title
Personal advice,I wish we could isolate a single country to see its progression over time.
Personal advice,Perhaps you could cut some text or make a few more slides.
Personal advice,"It seems more appropriate to use only the headers; in this way, neither"
Personal advice,data nor written information lose prominence.
Personal advice,I would maybe color the subject text or box to show the gender dominance
Personal advice,I would add another chart zooming in on some of the points that you make on increases and decreases.
Personal advice,I would perhaps recommend to space out the charts vertically as I am getting things a little mixed up
Personal advice,The only thing I would change from my side is to change color from black to white
Personal advice,If you are interested in growth in population at the county level and you want to highlight the growth of particular counties
Personal advice,I would use a bar graph of the (perhaps annualized) growth rates at the county level
Personal advice,You might also just show average growth rates of more and less urbanized areas.
Personal advice,That way you present the data and help the viewer to immediately see the difference between the more- and less-urbanized areas.I hope that helps
Personal advice,I have few suggestions
Personal advice,"I think it’s really good to start with raw numbers, but I would like to see this data as a percent of cats available at that age."
Personal advice,I would expect to see far less variance in adoption if the percentage available were taken into account.
Personal advice,i would recommend combining a few or the most related ones. This might have worked better as a bar graph
Personal advice,Just some comments. I think you could improve the chart on cats’ colors.
Personal advice,"If the goal is to highlight that black cats are more adopted than others, I think a pie would be better."
Personal advice,I think the color of graphics should match to the color of cats
Personal advice,"However, maybe I would had liked to see a comparison over the years, to see if it has increased or decreased around the world"
Personal advice,"However, I would had also liked to understand what happens with the fish line."
Personal advice,you might consider changing them.
Personal advice,I would have like to see one more bar graph of comparison so I could make sure that I was understanding the world map.
Personal advice,"so I suggest separating them by regions or ranges of results, so that it is pleasing to the eye."
Personal advice,I think (and I am just learning this now) that this project could benefit greatly from annotations
Personal advice,"Perhaps, in order to know whats states have the highest rates of gun violence"
Personal advice,"I think if I wanted to expand on this, I definitely want to start looking at the state level to see what is going on!"
Personal advice,"However, I think the map can be improved a bit."
Personal advice,but maybe you could use different map? Less colorful?
Personal advice,why not make the dots smaller and filled?
Personal advice,it could be interesting to compare with the population changes in these specific regions.
Personal advice,"I think it would have been better to show with population increase, certainly!"
Personal advice,it is good if we have the label that identify the year at the end of each line
Personal advice,the next level you may take the story to is explore the reasons on why the trend of gun shooting is going up
Personal advice,maybe add photos of main incidents according to the timeline of your story
Personal advice,"adding a human sense to the story would be good, so maybe add side bar stories on significant stories"
Personal advice,I think it would be great insert the level of ’high blood pressure’ each countries.
Personal advice,Some suggestions from my side:- your viz deserves a title!
Personal advice,Just let me to make some comments:
Personal advice,Perhaps it would be interesting the possibility to view all the numbers at the end of the effect
Personal advice,Exploring more these points could be interesting!
Personal advice,Herein some feedback:
Personal advice,"Though it would be relevant for other stats.2. I would make dots smallers, and letter of provinces larger."
Personal advice,Would be great to add 2 reference lines
Personal advice,"Your graph could use a grid, too."
Personal advice,The only critique I have is less of the content of your work than it is of trying to squeeze a visualization into a smaller screen or trying to adapt a viz so it accommodates all formats.
Personal advice,"And, I do not know if is possible, put Integration and"
Personal advice,Segregation area on bottom in the chart.
Personal advice,Things to think about for your next iteration of the chart.
Personal advice,"The one thing I would add is to include the names of the parties along with the logos, for the benefit of those of us who cannot read Hebrew."
Personal advice,"To fix that, I suggest adding another chart but withoutIndianapoilis’ numbers."
Expressing agreement,I didnt knew about the unlucky 27 but you convinced my about it with your analisis
Expressing agreement,Great topic!I certainly agree with your visual about the best decades!
Expressing agreement,I agree that your numbers show the incidences of disease has remained steady.
Expressing agreement,"Yeah, the idea of reported crimes is important here."

Expressing agreement,Indeed a mapping of the incidents will be helpful
Expressing agreement,I agree that making a map could be useful.
Expressing agreement,I agree that the interviews would be great as well as other stories
Expressing agreement,I have to agree that your graphic doesn’t really inform a discussion regarding the data
Expressing agreement,I agree with Brett.
Expressing agreement,I agree that normalizing by dividing by population could be the next step
Expressing agreement,It’s definitely a smart idea to look at the most successful grants and find out what made them work.
Expressing agreement,I do agree that the chart needed to be rotated.
Expressing agreement,I agree
Expressing agreement,with your comments on your PowerPoint that it seems like the maps
Expressing agreement,were more effective than other types of visualizations.
Expressing agreement,"I agree with you, Flourish has some limitations."

Asking questions,"One question that came to my mind is - what is the color encoding in your first chart meant to tell the audience?Do you think that each map needs a separate color, or could you have used the same color scheme?"
Asking questions,isn’t the title of each sub-chart enough?
Asking questions,Are these numbers affecting the current long waiting lists to the system?

Self-disclosure & expressing values,"Since I have worked with multiple data visualization tools, I know that they each have their pros and cons."
Self-disclosure & expressing values,"People don’t listen to full albuns nowadays, and artists tend not to work on them. So sad...As a music lover, just like you, I decided to play with data from Spotify on this exercise. I used Spotify Charts to show how many times an artist appears in the top 200 of the week."
Self-disclosure & expressing values,"Hello Angel,I have been to the Galicia region and can vouch that it is beautiful and filled with friendly people."
Self-disclosure & expressing values,"Hello Angel,Being a MD myself (worked 20 years in hospital) I am curious of course."
Self-disclosure & expressing values,"I’d be interested to find the data for my country, Australia. We have mining companies competing for some of our best agricultural land."
Self-disclosure & expressing values,As a map geek I really like to see your work
Self-disclosure & expressing values,"Dear Simon, thank you for taking time to comment and for your appreciations :)"
Self-disclosure & expressing values,"Actually i am interviewing the director of Demographics of the University of Costa Rica this week, to try to get a better context for this data analysis"
Self-disclosure & expressing values,"Here in the Philippines, family networks are very strong so we usually have extended families living at home with parents and grandchildren - so we are able to support them."
Self-disclosure & expressing values,This week i am going to interview the Director of Demographics of University of Costa Rica and going to make him your question. I will let you know
Self-disclosure & expressing values,I have visited Costa Rica twice and enjoyed it very much both times.
Self-disclosure & expressing values,"So I did in my """"school assignment"""",in a very simple way andunpretentious :)"
Self-disclosure & expressing values,As a former DC resident I found it particularly relevant.
Self-disclosure & expressing values,"As a Floridian that lives on a pond and .10 miles from undeveloped land, I’m cautious."
Self-disclosure & expressing values,As a resident of South Florida I am surprised of the percentage of Florida residents bitten by alligators.
Self-disclosure & expressing values,It contradicts my impression because I always see tourists walking right up to alligators like they were some tame animals.
Self-disclosure & expressing values,The last weekend my country (Colombia) vote for president and is just was an enlightenment.
Self-disclosure & expressing values,I work with data quite a bit and I think you learned a truism that usually the hardest part of data analysis is simply getting the data into a useful shape!
Self-disclosure & expressing values,"I know in my own assignment, the result was not what I had expected to do when I first started either!"
Self-disclosure & expressing values,"I’m vegetarian, so I don’t typically pay attention to trends in the seafood industry and the different trends in wild/farmed seafood."
Self-disclosure & expressing values,"I’m love reading about health trends, and seeing how causes of death have changed over the years is interesting."
Self-disclosure & expressing values,I’ve been to Utrecht one year ago and I stayed into two different hotels. I’m from France :)
Self-disclosure & expressing values,I grew up in Utrecht
Self-disclosure & expressing values,"My colleague looked at a different value. I looked at time from grant to publishing a research paper, and he looked at time from grant to award of a patent. Getting a patent through the US patent office can take quite a long time, so Im not surprised his time distribution was longer."
Self-disclosure & expressing values,"I tried using Flourish, but I ended up surrendering to Tableou as well."
Self-disclosure & expressing values,"However, I noticed that the information on happiness in this report conflicted with the report of the Gallup International Institute (another institution named Gallup), so I decided to use the data on generosity"
Self-disclosure & expressing values,now I want to live in Bulgaria!
Self-disclosure & expressing values,This is a topic I really loved to read during my graduation. I really liked to try to find correlations and causations between happiness and economic development.
Self-disclosure & expressing values,"I’m not a big fan of anything that starts to move or make sound without user interaction, but in this particular case (many people didn’t know where to start / what to do) it’s probably necessary."
Self-disclosure & expressing values,"I’m coming more from the communication side, making data look compelling and (hopefully) easy to read is my job. Obviously I influence how people read the data to some extent, but I try not to push people to conclusions."
Self-disclosure & expressing values,I come from an analyst side.
Self-disclosure & expressing values,"I was learning from Flourish as well, but I ended up migrating to Tableou because I had a less daring goal of visualizing data on generosity in the world."
Self-disclosure & expressing values,I am a big fan of choosing one color and multiple gradients and combining with a grey background.
Self-disclosure & expressing values,"I am not a native English-speaker, but I think you misused the terms, as mouse=singular and mice=plural"
Self-disclosure & expressing values,"I’m from Spain, and I was surprised that Spain is leader in quality but not at all in quantity"
Self-disclosure & expressing values,Kind regards from another cheese lover!
Self-disclosure & expressing values,Your story has made me hungry...off to find some cheese!
Self-disclosure & expressing values,I guess my project theme hasn’t so many possibilities to use all these types.
Self-disclosure & expressing values,I’m going to look for some of those films on my Netflix!
Self-disclosure & expressing values,"I don’t know if you know about this datavis, it’s amazing. From 2011, but still my favourite."
Self-disclosure & expressing values,hopefully I will not be in that statistic and stay happy with age
Self-disclosure & expressing values,This will help me in deciding where to travel in Europe next year!
Self-disclosure & expressing values,"I am studying Fragility, but I did not know that this feeling was so comprehensive."
Self-disclosure & expressing values,"I tried to use it too, but I ended up with Tableou.I explored the same theme as well"
Self-disclosure & expressing values,"I took inspiration from the sample chart that already had a lot of """"bubble"""""
Self-disclosure & expressing values,"In Luxembourg they don’t care at all of the environment, in Sweden the most of the energy is renewable, big countries are slower in their energetic conversion to renewables."
Self-disclosure & expressing values,I love to see that Europe is going green! And Ive seen that in
Self-disclosure & expressing values,American countries interesting things are also being done to care for the
Self-disclosure & expressing values,"environment, although theres still much to be done."
Self-disclosure & expressing values,I also use a lot of Tableau for many things.
Self-disclosure & expressing values,Former Scott
Self-disclosure & expressing values,County resident here.
Self-disclosure & expressing values,"As a parent of two adopted cats, I’m pleased with the results."
Self-disclosure & expressing values,"And not just because my favourite club, Manchester City, was so well represented in the 2018 World Cup. ;-)"
Self-disclosure & expressing values,"I live in Argentina, where everyone is always trying to argue that Messi is the greatest of all time, despite the fact he has never won a World Cup."
Self-disclosure & expressing values,I’m colorblind and I do not really appreciate the colors in the bar graphs
Self-disclosure & expressing values,"Since I am from Spain, I understand the concepts of """"Mil euristas""""."
Positive Activating,I should indeed be able to do a separate analysis by decades.
Positive Activating,"I’m particularly intrigued by your theory of how air transport safety has improved -- something that never occurred to me, despite my former career as an aerospace engineer!"
Positive Activating,I will continue my exploration and get back to you with my results
Positive Activating,I’m glad you like the work I’ve done so far. Many thanks for the suggestions!
Positive Activating,I was also very curious about the possible connection between cause of death and genre of music
Positive Activating,"the current dataset doesn’t have genre as a separate column, but it would not be difficult to add"
Positive Activating,But it’s certainly worth exploring
Positive Activating,"However, this is not a particularly onerous task in Excel.I hope to return here with further insights."
Positive Activating,There is so much to explore here
Positive Activating,I’d love to dig into this as well.
Positive Activating,"Hi, Perry --I’m hoping to dig into some of the areas you’ve mentioned."
Positive Activating,There’s certainly many more ways to slice & dice the data!
Positive Activating,"I suspect the """"27 Club"""" is more of a rock thing"
Positive Activating,Thanks for sharing the visualizations!
Positive Activating,"While that is much data for one visualization, it would be very cool to see"
Positive Activating,"Those dynamics may be hard to measure, but the mass northward migration would be interesting to track over a similar time frame."
Positive Activating,"Hi Charlotte, very interesting topic, you have opened quite a lot the research, spared no effort to understand your data in various ways, this is very cool."
Positive Activating,"Anyway, good exploration work!"
Positive Activating,"I’m glad that our instructor introduced us to the iNZight tool because it has a web-based function, and is pretty intuitive."
Positive Activating,Great share and explanation of what you did
Positive Activating,This is cool!This confirms my personal impression that people don’t make music as good as they used to :)
Positive Activating,I wonder if this also say something about the average age of the publication’s readers.
Positive Activating,"I wonder how many bands got on the list for great debut albums as opposed to great second, third, etc. albums"
Positive Activating,This is a great topic. I hope you dig deeper with it!
Positive Activating,"Santiago,I really like that you chose data visualizations that were part of our lecture"
Positive Activating,There was a post from DB 01 that focused on the popular US TV show called Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Your post is similar to that one because it shows that playing with data can be fun and cool.
Positive Activating,Showing the fun and coolness factors are gateways into the data science field that get people who are uncomfortable using data science to realize that anyone -- including them -- can do it.
Positive Activating,"Hello Angel,Being a MD myself (worked 20 years in hospital) I am curious of course."
Positive Activating,It would definitely be worth looking into.
Positive Activating,A topic that is of great interest to me!
Positive Activating,Interesting to see that class size and sat score are not directly correlated.
Positive Activating,"Of the notable data, I found the class size view very interesting"
Positive Activating,"That said, I know this was a rough draft and more targeted toward finding stories in the data; not a final visual presentation of the data. So all is forgiven!"
Positive Activating,I love that it is interactive and that the bubbles expand once hovered over.
Positive Activating,I also really like your stacked bar graph.
Positive Activating,"Jorge,That’s an interesting question you decided to investigate here.It made me wondering:Are CO2 emissions lower in the countries where the environmental taxes are higher?"
Positive Activating,"Jorge,Wonderful work!"
Positive Activating,You’ve selected a topic with fascinating public policy implications.
Positive Activating,"I love the idea of looking at agricultural land use - I’d be interested to find the data for my country, Australia."
Positive Activating,The Togo data is intriguing.
Positive Activating,I found your topic to be very interesting and I learned something new today.
Positive Activating,Thanks again for sharing this data story!
Positive Activating,"I think there should be even better way than those two, but still exploring."
Positive Activating,"That’s what I was wondering as well, Stephan."
Positive Activating,"I think what would be interesting to see is how the mix of grains fluctuate, particularly among the top trade partners."
Positive Activating,That would be interesting to know because it might shed some light on China importing Canola.
Positive Activating,It is interesting that we use similar strategies to present our data.
Positive Activating,I was wondering if any sales has been done during 2015 and 2016.
Positive Activating,"I think it’s interesting because I would expect that the U.S. and Mexico would make up a large portion of the exports, but seeing it compared to Asia is a stark difference."
Positive Activating,Population ageing is a very interesting topic to study
Positive Activating,"Hi TJ, i am glad to hear that you had good times in my country!"
Positive Activating,Sankey diagrams always result in the most impressive-looking data visualizations.
Positive Activating,Interesting theme.
Positive Activating,I hope she gets the chance to repost the data - it’s very interesting data given the interest girls’ education has garnered in recent years.
Positive Activating,We shall not be discouraged but aware of the reality and be hopefull that more and more institutionsare transparent with their data and make it easy of access.
Positive Activating,"Hi Santiago,Happy to be helpful."
Positive Activating,Just curious.
Positive Activating,This topic is very interesting!
Positive Activating,The topic of data visualization is very interesting.
Positive Activating,Hi!That is a GREAT topic! :)
Positive Activating,These smaller and more concrete topics are perfect for finding a local story that can be actually interesting to read or to see as an infographic for anyone!
Positive Activating,I think it is really interesting that using these visualizations enabled you to discover that Qatar has many outliers.
Positive Activating,"this helped you find out about the peculiar situation in Qatar, which is in my opinion really intriguing."
Positive Activating,"I’m still new at this, but seeing how you presented this makes me want to go back and play with Inzight some more again with a new data set."
Positive Activating,There’s definitely room here to investigate further.
Positive Activating,that’s a really interesting path you’ve taken
Positive Activating,I would love to know for instance why some diseases are becoming less lethal
Positive Activating,"I’d also like to see what are the most common """"unintentional injuries,"""" since that’s a pretty broad category."
Positive Activating,"I found another interesting clue in your first graph is that generally, there is a descending trend from 2012 to 2014"
Positive Activating,I found it might be an interesting sign for the tourism industry
Positive Activating,Interesting to see the dip in 2013 and 2014 for a many countries.
Positive Activating,Very interesting
Positive Activating,That’s great that this course is so helpful for your work.
Positive Activating,Just wondering about a couple of things:
Positive Activating,I’m curious to know what if anything surprised you about the findings?
Positive Activating,I really gained some insights through your analysis.
Positive Activating,"I didn’t know that about Bhutan, that is quite interesting."
Positive Activating,I’m glad you liked the project!
Positive Activating,The chart I found most interesting wasChanging Tides
Positive Activating,The movement in the Ukraine was particularly interesting to me
Positive Activating,"Admiring the dataset you used, has a lot of information that might be important to change the way people think."
Positive Activating,I loved this
Positive Activating,This project really opened up my perspectives of what I could do with Data Visualisation.
Positive Activating,"your visualisation of the everyday madness is absolutely shocking, too"
Positive Activating,it’s amazing how little you need to understand of the actual subject matter to see where there are
Positive Activating,"This looks like it was so fun to create, and I can definitely see why you are inspired to learn more to be do even more customized works, as there is obviously so much potential!"
Positive Activating,"I’ll have to think about that, maybe that would be a good solution."
Positive Activating,I need to dive into Flourish more.
Positive Activating,This is astounding!
Positive Activating,There is no doubt that Flourishes extraordinary. It has so many options and visualization looks more attractive and reader-friendly.
Positive Activating,There is a clear emotional engagement in your visualization.
Positive Activating,"I am new to all things about data visualization, and I appreciate your project."
Positive Activating,I didn’t know Tableau could do that!
Positive Activating,Makes me want to try using Tableau for a story and not only for one visualisation.
Positive Activating,"Curious what your level of expertise is with Tableau, and how long this took to create."
Positive Activating,I find it interesting that Afghanistan imports goods from Kenya.
Positive Activating,Kenya was surprise for sure
Positive Activating,I was surprised by the difference between India being ranked 1st in ticket sales but 4th in revenue.
Positive Activating,That might make for an interesting deeper look.
Positive Activating,It would be great to compare budget and revenue. I’ll keep looking
Positive Activating,The possibilities are endless... :-)
Positive Activating,I’ll work on that visualization. I am sure population and ticket sales are correlated.
Positive Activating,I found the third slide very interesting since it shows that Hindi is not the only language that dominates Indian film industry
Positive Activating,The fourth slide too was very interesting considering we release our films in multiple territories and how China has opened has a very interesting new territory.It will be interesting to explore how the density of multiplex screens has increased as they say India is the most under-screened country
Positive Activating,Wow! I didn’t know how big it was until I saw your charts.
Positive Activating,I did not realize how lucrative it is
Positive Activating,"Wow, was Nigeria really second movie producer in the world for a long time? That’s surprising."
Positive Activating,very helpful for seeing your slide
Positive Activating,I had no idea bollywood movies have such popularity over the world!
Positive Activating,"I feel attached that I am also fun of Indian films. it is interesting to know the comparison with other films.Your presentation, makes me interested to know more insights into the differences in various regions."
Positive Activating,I think you really succeeded in getting people to get a much better grasp of Bollywood in a few quick visual slides
Positive Activating,This helped me read very easy the variables.
Positive Activating,"It’s something you always wants to know, but sometimes embarrassing to see what pops up."
Positive Activating,I’m still triggered by Moritz Stefaner with OECD dataset
Positive Activating,I would love to see something like this in a more global scale.
Positive Activating,would be interesting to understand why.
Positive Activating,It is a great visualization that makes me want to learn more.
Positive Activating,This will help me in deciding where to travel in Europe next year!
Positive Activating,I was very impressed to know that most of the elderly are almost always sad.
Positive Activating,That is fantastic I need to read and see how you created this table with the chart behind it!
Positive Activating,I was very interested in the topic too.
Positive Activating,I’ve changed the story accordingly and am curious to hear what you think.
Positive Activating,Curious to hear your thoughts and improve the viz!
Positive Activating,I got really interested in the Sankey visuals
Positive Activating,I was amazed at how some counties had lost their income level on an inflation adjusted basis.
Positive Activating,I wanted to try them for the population percentage as well.
Positive Activating,I understand your frustrations with Florishs limitations.
Positive Activating,Hoping this will work better.
Positive Activating,Hoping this will work better.
Positive Activating,I was fascinated to see that you incorporated Flourish into your PowerPoint
Positive Activating,I found your World Cup data story to be extremely interesting.
Positive Activating,there are a lot of data behind these maps... wow.
Positive Activating,I was highly interested in California after looking at the two maps after a while.
Positive Activating,I was curious if I could combine two of the Flourish maps that could do both the bubble data and add the stories that go along with the incidents.
Positive Activating,I wonder if any custom CSS could accomplish this?
Positive Activating,"I never really gave it a second thought to putting state names down, but it could be helpful."
Positive Activating,Exploring more these points could be interesting!
Positive Activating,"At first I laugh at the library, the picture is so humorous."
Positive Activating,Wow. What a complex yet simplified presentation.
Positive Activating,"Despite this, most of the visualizations in your story helped me understand the system and the balance of power in Israel."
Positive Activating,"On the whole, though, a thoughtful, thorough, commendable, and inspring introduction to the Israeli government and electorate."
Positive Activating,What an
Positive Activating,excellent work. Much incredible and simple visualization for a such complex
Positive Activating,theme.
Positive Activating,"But I understand from your words that all this is not necessarily obvious, so I will endeavor to make it clearer."
Positive Activating,"I hope that Flourish will add this feature in the future, though."
Positive Activating,I learned a lot of things with your information.
Positive Activating,This is extremely impressive!
Positive Activating,"While I do have some knowledge of Israel’s multiple-party system, your data story has made things much clearer."
Positive Activating,"I am particularly impressed with your """"binning"""" the political parties into your SIDE mnemonic, which greatly simplifies the understanding of the situation."
Positive Activating,Any additional comments/feedback welcomed.
Positive Activating,I too had some trouble with Flourish. I think your findings are really interesting and I hope you dig deeper!
Negative Deactivating,"the most extreme example being Arthur Russell, who is almost unclassifiable"
Negative Deactivating,"Since you opened the variables a lot, it was difficult for me to come to a conclusion"
Negative Deactivating,It must be really hard to be an original popular musician these days.
Negative Deactivating,"People don’t listen to full albuns nowadays, and artists tend not to work on them. So sad..."
Negative Deactivating,So sad to see no rock artists in the top twenty
Negative Deactivating,"I’m still working on it, but unfortunately cannot find a good data source to make such comparisons."
Negative Deactivating,"Still a very relevant insight to explore, unfortunately."
Negative Deactivating,"There was data about rank, but I couldn’t find a way in iNZight to combine this variable with the other variables."
Negative Deactivating,"Yes I understand. I also had the same problem in iNZigh, so I just gave up and went to Illustrator."
Negative Deactivating,"I think that it could be interesting make a comparision between the age of the hospitalized people and its diseases, but I haven’t find the data."
Negative Deactivating,Using the same color scheme for race/ethnicity AND geographic location was a poor choice.
Negative Deactivating,"To compare these kinds of data is often misleading, standardization might be tricky and maybe even impossible."
Negative Deactivating,this is very expensive and demands a lot of work
Negative Deactivating,However this is far from reality
Negative Deactivating,"data is often filled with missing values, repeated values, messy tables, incoherence, and more."
Negative Deactivating,Let say that was not a possibility.
Negative Deactivating,"I did make a graph, but for some reason when I tried to attach it to the post it did not work."
Negative Deactivating,I am sometimes so bored already by all that population data or so.
Negative Deactivating,the data provided by the election management committee is disjointed
Negative Deactivating,I think the chart you chose makes it harder to understand the finding here.
Negative Deactivating,I don’t think the facets help you
Negative Deactivating,that might not have been helpful.
Negative Deactivating,but the opportunity to customize the templates is very limited.
Negative Deactivating,I was not able topush the play button successfully.
Negative Deactivating,I’m sorry the interactive version did not work for you
Negative Deactivating,"but the way this particular Flourish-template is set up the circle-colour is linked to the colour of the graph, which was then very hard to read."
Negative Deactivating,What may have caused the flare up I have no idea...
Negative Deactivating,I don’t know.
Negative Deactivating,"I’m not happy with the counter on the top either, It doesn’t properly bin (bundle) the cumulative values"
Negative Deactivating,"the slider is too imprecise to actually properl """"land"""" on events."
Negative Deactivating,there are too few possibilities to configure/customise the templates.
Negative Deactivating,"I’m afraid I can’t move the counter, it comes with the template and you can either have it displayed or not, but nothing more."
Negative Deactivating,the templates are a bit limited
Negative Deactivating,"But, the only issue I found is that scatter plot visualization looks messy and concise on a phone’s screen."
Negative Deactivating,there is nothing to see.
Negative Deactivating,but I think you put too much emphasis on this part
Negative Deactivating,Animations do not convince me: they are too difficult to interpret.
Negative Deactivating,I just didn’t have time to work with it any longer
Negative Deactivating,I am sorry that the PowerPoint link isn’t working for you.
Negative Deactivating,I don’t know what else to do with it as I don’t think I can embed the file directly into the course emails system.
Negative Deactivating,"After I had spent a couple of hours with it, I went back to my regular software"
Negative Deactivating,Flourish has some limitations.
Negative Deactivating,I have tried to modify the legend but I have not succeeded.
Negative Deactivating,Unfortunately the article in The Washington post was behind a paywall so I couldn’t access it
Negative Deactivating,I am sorry that the article was behind a paywall.
Negative Deactivating,"There was just so much, so I started running a different column instead to simplify it since there was so much data to look at."
Negative Deactivating,I felt redirecting the audience to a different page so the graphic could load better was a sacrifice I had to make in this instance.
Negative Deactivating,And I think there are no dramatic change when I look at it.
Negative Deactivating,"I can not see any more regions of Israel, and"
Negative Deactivating,bubbles alone not say too much for me.
Negative Deactivating,"Unfortunately, Flourish does not yet allow graphics like maps to be displayed underneath scatter plots;"
Negative Deactivating,"However, I don’t see treemaps as the ideal for your story."
Negative Deactivating,"Also, I missed charts with death per decades and not only by track."
Positive Deactivating,The work you’ve done to gather and clean this data is impressive enough on its own.
Positive Deactivating,This is cool!This confirms my personal impression that people don’t make music as good as they used to :)
Positive Deactivating,it was quite easy for me to understand the out in your charts
Positive Deactivating,Breaking it up in intervals of 500 was easier for me to discern than the stacked bar chart that broke it up in intervals of 1000.
Positive Deactivating,I had no trouble following the story.
Positive Deactivating,"At this point, I was happy to be able to generate the box plot in insight"
Positive Deactivating,The data show us the way. Hahaha.
Positive Deactivating,It makes it really easy to see where crime is happening across the city without going into a full mapping application.
Positive Deactivating,I find the comparison and the matrix of visualisations you have chosen very interesting and easy to understand.
Positive Deactivating,The matrix of graphs is really helpful to compare and extract patterns between the different countries
Positive Deactivating,the visual is simple and easy to read.
Positive Deactivating,It’s really simple and clearly showing the trends of tourists from different countries.
Positive Deactivating,"Nice chart, easy to understand."
Positive Deactivating,You summarized the information and made it easier to understand. My eyes did not have to do so much work.
Positive Deactivating,I could understand the whole story without hovering my mouse on a particular point.
Positive Deactivating,The high level of interactivity allows the reader to look specifically at the data that interests him/her the most.
Positive Deactivating,You cut the data in easy to understand ways
Positive Deactivating,It was easy to select and use the information
Positive Deactivating,its good to know people understand the explanations
Positive Deactivating,The data confirm it.
Positive Deactivating,I would ideally like to have made the map with revenue from each country but that data is not available.
Positive Deactivating,I learned a lot - great topic!
Positive Deactivating,it looks ideal for investigation.
Positive Deactivating,your implementation allows you to interact with the data to explore what you are interested in
Positive Deactivating,there’s not much to complain about.
Positive Deactivating,works very well as an interactive exploration tool
Positive Deactivating,Everything seems to support your initial thesis
Positive Deactivating,Adding a sidebar actually started to crash my Chrome when completing this.
Positive Deactivating,And good to know that more and more people in Spain return to work.
Positive Deactivating,The audience could more easily recognize and understand the man destroy how much badly.
Negative Activating,One potential problem is that there are musicians who played different genres of music
Negative Activating,"Ironically, a local radio station here in Colorado was doing a segment on this very topic."
Negative Activating,"I’ve done a lot of cleaning (alas, mostly by hand), but there are still likely some errors."
Negative Activating,"Obviously, the spike at age 27 is unique and unnatural. But I’d like to know: just how unique is it?"
Negative Activating,I just discovered that my dataset is missing some prominent jazz musicians!
Negative Activating,"The first chart, I was wandering about the grey lines. There is no country connected to them."
Negative Activating,"I realize I wrote more about process than actual observations in my data. This was primarily because there were so many comparisons to draw, it did get confusing, and I wasn’t sure what kind of statement I wanted to make with this particular data set."
Negative Activating,"When I started reading your analysis, I was going to be shocked that a disease or a combination of diseases accounted for the population loss."
Negative Activating,"Myself, I am new to the idea and this has been a challenge."
Negative Activating,I’m confused without a title to each graph.
Negative Activating,I’m questioning whether this data accurately counted the percentage of ELLs at each school.
Negative Activating,it seems strange to me that *none* of them are English-language learners.
Negative Activating,I did find it confusing though that you used the same color palette to for the boroughs in the map as you did for the races in the stacked bar.
Negative Activating,I was also concerned about the colors repeating for different purposes.
Negative Activating,"Like many of the commenters here, I am concerned about your color choices."
Negative Activating,My only concern is that the data is so highly concentrated in the bottom left of the graphs and it can get difficult to tell them apart due to colors of the same hue but different opacity.
Negative Activating,I sometimes find the stacked bar chart difficult to interpret in terms of understanding which category has the greatest quantity
Negative Activating,Indeed it was not obvious for me which one of charts will represent better data over time
Negative Activating,Eastern Europe amount is barely noticeable.
Negative Activating,I had some difficulty identifying the continent on graph 4.
Negative Activating,"This analysis, in deep, left me lot of questions."
Negative Activating,"I am not sure if I would know what percentage is """"a lot"""" of young people and what percentage is """"a lot"""" of old people."
Negative Activating,I had some difficulty understanding the colours on the right-hand side
Negative Activating,I’ve found it a bit difficult to read into the data from the visualisation in this kind of presentation.
Negative Activating,"can’t figure out how to get rid of the country codes on the side, which is problematic b/c there are more countries than there is room for on the image."
Negative Activating,Trying to get data into the right format will always be a challenge.
Negative Activating,The second one (in my point of view) is one the most demanding and crucial as there are many challenges to overcome.
Negative Activating,"But now I’m not sure for where I live, I’m cautious enough by your observations."
Negative Activating,"please excuse my horrible attempt for a quick map, so sorry!"
Negative Activating,it is a barrier that it seems difficult to trace the historical change.
Negative Activating,the hardest part of data analysis is simply getting the data into a useful shape
Negative Activating,I can sympathize with the inconsistency in data sources.
Negative Activating,Cleaning and formatting the data is usually half the battle.
Negative Activating,"To be honest, I didn’t expect this to be so frustrating at times :)"
Negative Activating,Sorry attachments were missed in the original post the process was not quite clear.
Negative Activating,Sorry about the last graph being too small to read.
Negative Activating,I’m left wondering why 11 has no data displayed at all.
Negative Activating,My only quibble with the visual is the labels on each line the key on the bottom was enough for me to follow the trends.
Negative Activating,I made a mistake and linked the wrong version of the project.
Negative Activating,"I found a bright colour or two at the lower end of the happiness index, which is a bit confusing visually"
Negative Activating,I also have to keep going back to the key to remind myself which color represents which country.
Negative Activating,I don’t really agree with the chart option you gave because it looks like a scatterplot without being one which can be confusing
Negative Activating,"I think the first and second page is so many color and no label for each bar, so i think it’s hard to read."
Negative Activating,One small item I was confused about is the Y Axis and data detail mapping on the bar chart
Negative Activating,It led me to more questions.
Negative Activating,interpretation of the data is always tricky.
Negative Activating,I find that it’s hard to look at the timeline at the bottom
Negative Activating,I feel like I’m missing a lot of information
Negative Activating,It all seems to go very fast and you have to pause to really absorb.
Negative Activating,"I couldn’t really tell it it was giving a cumulative toll, or the toll in specific instances."
Negative Activating,that may be a flourish problem.
Negative Activating,"Still I’d like to be able to """"tinker"""" with the Flourish templates a bit more"
Negative Activating,"it took me quite some time to realise it, too."
Negative Activating,I do not know if there is a chance to fit the size of the explosion with the number of victims.
Negative Activating,But... but there’s a problem.you have not thought about other risks for the little mouse.
Negative Activating,IT’s a bit difficult to understand at a first glance the rankings
Negative Activating,It took me a few minutes to figure this out.
Negative Activating,I would only say that the typeface is less readable than desired
Negative Activating,It took a while to try and get an understanding for the other Flourish visuals
Negative Activating,I struggled to give it good context and colourMore could be done with its features which i did not explore fully
Negative Activating,"Without the labels, it’s hard to tell the percentages"
Negative Activating,"I have a question, though, I haven’t seen any statistics about budget."
Negative Activating,please help me to clarify a topic
Negative Activating,I miss the legend for the animated graph (unless it’s hidden somewhere I can’t see it)
Negative Activating,apparently the UNESCO data is incomplete
Negative Activating,"so there have been some issues about what to count as """"films"""" by data aggregators"
Negative Activating,"I should explain what Bollywood is, I assumed everyone would know."
Negative Activating,"The map in the current format does not bring any info, it just confuses me."
Negative Activating,The only thing I was wondering about is slide no. 4.
Negative Activating,I have often trouble with data in this kind of way.
Negative Activating,"I can understand why somewhere is happening something, but I cannot use any right data to prove it."
Negative Activating,The only hiccup seemed to be slide 4
Negative Activating,I didn’t understand how that fit exactly into the narrative
Negative Activating,"It seems there are some issues with your submissions, look:"
Negative Activating,The only thing that was difficult to me when reading the graphics was the order of the countries.
Negative Activating,"I tried to find them in the graphic, but this took me some"
Negative Activating,time.
Negative Activating,"The only criticism I could make (but that I don’t know how to fix either, is that in the first slide, it’s difficult to discern trends."
Negative Activating,A more technical question: I tried to make separate bar charts (first page in your story) but I couldn’t find the right way to select columns to get the legenda on top.
Negative Activating,I saw that the information on happiness in this report conflicted with the report of the Gallup International Institute
Negative Activating,"There is also a cool possibility to compare some the graphs, but lots of graphs a little bit to hard."
Negative Activating,I had to minimize the information I was using in Inzight so I could manage to create a chart.
Negative Activating,the grey text box overlapping the data as being too distracting
Negative Activating,I think the header space is too easy to miss.
Negative Activating,"there are a lot of text, both in the caption of the story and in the text/image-slides. That sometimes makes it hard to see the information."
Negative Activating,I was
Negative Activating,also distracted by the gray text box overlapping the data.
Negative Activating,"I actually tried doing that, but then found out the lines overlapped quite a bit"
Negative Activating,I would perhaps recommend to space out the charts vertically as I am getting things a little mixed up
Negative Activating,"I’m sorry, English is not my first language and with these technical things it’s sometimes difficult to understand the terms. :)"
Negative Activating,I wasn’t quite sure
Negative Activating,what to make of the Sankey diagrams
Negative Activating,Some having trouble with the original posting.
Negative Activating,I was unable to get to the page for your PowerPoint slides
Negative Activating,it was too long to fit in the discussion window (on my tablet) so I could not select it to open it
Negative Activating,but after I had done several I couldn’t get the scaling to hold when going back and forth to them.
Negative Activating,Always something else to do and learn.
Negative Activating,I had some trouble knowing what point you were trying to make.
Negative Activating,Just couldn’t get Flourish to work for just one state’s counties.
Negative Activating,"I have never used Tableau, so I expect it is hard to change legends"
Negative Activating,I think there are too many categories
Negative Activating,A very difficult issue because of the consequences on people.
Negative Activating,"However, I can’t understand the 3rd slide"
Negative Activating,it is a bit of a hairball and hard to understand
Negative Activating,It is hard to tell throughout what point you are trying to make
Negative Activating,The network diagram is a bit confusing at first glance
Negative Activating,I also had some issues with Flourish
Negative Activating,"I’m sorry, just the colors that I used are red and green.I had not thought about colorblinds"
Negative Activating,"Indeed, it is not clear, it means that there is no data for the greyed out regions."
Negative Activating,only that in the graphics the information was very crowded for the amount of countries
Negative Activating,but I had a little trouble understanding what was the thread tying all of these visualizations together.
Negative Activating,"For some reason, it struck me because 2018 started having more than usual"
Negative Activating,The only thing I am concerned is it being too much crowding.
Negative Activating,"Though, you are right. I should be labeling them."
Negative Activating,I can’t read the name of the provinces (I suppose because of the size width of the div class)
Negative Activating,"However, two in two different moments, the graph shows a disturbing in a pattern."
Negative Activating,I don’t understand what the each bar means.
Negative Activating,"I love the lead and the conclusion drawn by the graphs here, but I have one worry."
Negative Activating,"Your second is a bit complicated, though."
Negative Activating,I agree the second is complicated and I was just unsure what to do about that
Negative Activating,if the names of the commodities were not so long I think I would have tried other things first
Negative Activating,I don’t know the answer.
Negative Activating,"I have some doubts about the numbers, those for the different ages seem much too high to me."
Negative Activating,"At the bottom of the chart, several small parties have similar results over time, so they overlap one another, and make the chart hard to read."
Negative Activating,"For several of your slides, at least on my little iPad, the grey annotation block was laid right on top of the viz, partially obscuring the viz, or at least distracting from it, despite the grey block being somewhat transparent."
Negative Activating,I found the graph a little bit difficult to understand.
Negative Activating,I lost a perception of a map.
Negative Activating,"While you have in fact done this on slide 2, I found it difficult to remember by the time I made it to slide 10."
Negative Activating,Sometimes it is a bit confusing to spot the differences between small values
