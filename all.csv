Personal advice,It is good to see more details on this.
Vocatives (addressing individual),"Hi Daniel,Thanks for your comments."
Positive Deactivating,This is cool!This confirms my personal impression that people don’t make music as good as they used to :)
"Complementing, expressing appreciation",The final result is quite compelling and really works.
Negative Activating,"I love the lead and the conclusion drawn by the graphs here, but I have one worry."
Asking questions,"Did you find any similarities about these two groups (or conversely, something very different about small towns)?"
"Complementing, expressing appreciation",Many thanks for the suggestions!
Positive Activating,I only wish I had produced a visualisation as effective as this!
Negative Activating,"I tried to find them in the graphic, but this took me some"

Asking questions,In which year does the population data start in relation to 2015?
Negative Activating,A more technical question: I tried to make separate bar charts (first page in your story) but I couldn’t find the right way to select columns to get the legenda on top.
"Complementing, expressing appreciation",Really good work. You have an eye for making good visualizations.
"Complementing, expressing appreciation",Thank you for the link

Personal advice,This would allow you to see changes in staffing over time.
Unconventional emotion expression,Probably the question I mostly have is how does your histogram look so much cleaner than mine :-).
Unconventional emotion expression,Thanks for your feedback :D
Negative Activating,It took me a few minutes to figure this out.
Positive Activating,hope you can see the file now.
Positive Activating,"That said, I know this was a rough draft and more targeted toward finding stories in the data; not a final visual presentation of the data. So all is forgiven!"
Vocatives (addressing individual),"Very cool, thanks, TJ!"
Expressing agreement,I agree
Asking questions,Were they using a different data set?
Vocatives (addressing individual),"Hello Gabriela,Your work was very enlightening!"
"Complementing, expressing appreciation","Very cool, thanks, TJ!"

Negative Activating,"Though, you are right. I should be labeling them."

Negative Deactivating,And I think there are no dramatic change when I look at it.

Vocatives (addressing individual),"Hi Vlad,What a great work you did."
Personal advice,"My suggestion for the first chart would be the line chart, which allows for a better comparison across continents over the years. In the second chart I think the information could be complemented using a map. So it looks visually beautiful, the information gets highlighted and the data does not get stuck to the table."
Expressing disagreement,I wonder if using red for the whole visualisation was the right choice.
Expressing agreement,with your comments on your PowerPoint that it seems like the maps
"Complementing, expressing appreciation","Hi Valentina,I really like your use of the borough icons as filters in your dashboards!"

Personal advice,I would perhaps recommend to space out the charts vertically as I am getting things a little mixed up

Asking questions,"Was this the lite version of Flourish, or was this the downloaded version?"
Vocatives (addressing individual),Hi Katica

Vocatives (addressing individual),Hello Katika!
"Phatics, salutations and greetings, Social sharing","Hi Nuria,I’m commenting on yours because your analysis is really good and great that you have submitted two chart suggestions which are original and made me think differently about how to present the data."

Asking questions,"Could I ask you what you mean by """"space out the charts vertically""""? Do you mean to add more space between the charts for the different subjects?"
Expressing disagreement,But in the point with the label inside the bars I think that can be more confused because in the graph have a lot of visual encoding and other inside other can be more heavy to understand.
Asking questions,would that be too much?

Personal advice,Maybe you can bring in complementary data to see if there is a correlation between the amount of revenue a department brings in and how much its faculty is compensated?
Expressing agreement,"You are completely right with the imagen about different sexs and the color I think the same is better in the classic form, because is more easy to understand."

"Complementing, expressing appreciation","Wow, Takura. This was such an interesting visualization and story to see and read."

Negative Activating,"2007 is when the U.S stock market crashed, and I wonder if that reduced the amount of giving for some western nations."

Vocatives (addressing individual),"Hi Donna,your analysis is simple and clear."

Expressing disagreement,I was also concerned about the colors repeating for different purposes.

Vocatives (addressing individual),"Hey Kathleen, very nice job."
Quoting from others' messages & Referring explicitly to others' messages,"I found a dataset in World Bank too about Health nutrition and population that might help you with the missing information, this is per country and maybe you can add a comparison in the countries you already have and not only information about HIV but also the nutrition the people who has it is getting: https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/dataset/health-nutrition-and-population-statistics-wealth-quintileRegards!"
Personal advice,Exploring more these points could be interesting!

Asking questions,"Was there a rapid increase of jobs created over this period, or are the vacancies due to some other factors?"

"Complementing, expressing appreciation",This is a great topic. I hope you dig deeper with it!
Asking questions,Perhaps there is a way to have a single chart with many lines and as you hover over each one the colors could pop out and highlight the lines?
Asking questions,"Is it to find out which markets are potentially interesting for sponsors, because they combine a large TV audience and a relatively high income?"
"Complementing, expressing appreciation",the time to try to use them.
Negative Activating,My only quibble with the visual is the labels on each line the key on the bottom was enough for me to follow the trends.
"Complementing, expressing appreciation","Annabelle, your story made me smile :-)"
Negative Activating,it seems strange to me that *none* of them are English-language learners.
Positive Activating,Glad to see I wasn’t the only one with a lengthy list. :-)
Negative Activating,I wonder if it would be more informative to show the difference in the percentage of the population instead of the growth rate.
Asking questions,"For your scatter plot idea, how would you define your axes and what if any encoding would you apply to highlight income category, country, and sex?"
Unconventional emotion expression,That’s a very interesting idea :)

"Phatics, salutations and greetings, Social sharing","Hi, Mario."
"Complementing, expressing appreciation",Congratulations for your work and effort.
Addresses or refers to the group using inclusive pronouns (addressing the whole group),I agree with some of the other comments that a good next step would be to investigate the use of color
Unconventional emotion expression,then map would’ve been the best idea. But it’s only my own vision and I don’t think that it is the only one right way to show the story :)
Expressing disagreement,"However, I think they are all too many."
"Phatics, salutations and greetings, Social sharing","Hi Maseme,Very interesting finding, especially when linked to the HIV treatment trend."

Expressing agreement,"I also believe the same, a horizontal bar chart would help to better understand this information."
Personal advice,Just two minor nitpicks/questions:
Asking questions,Why is this?
Negative Deactivating,"I’m not happy with the counter on the top either, It doesn’t properly bin (bundle) the cumulative values"
Negative Deactivating,"I think that it could be interesting make a comparision between the age of the hospitalized people and its diseases, but I haven’t find the data."
"Complementing, expressing appreciation",I love the use of animation in this story.
Expressing agreement,"Hi Jaime,I agree that the strings are somewhat distracting from the purpose of the map!"
Negative Activating,I also had some issues with Flourish

Positive Activating,I’d love to dig into this as well.
Unconventional emotion expression,"Wow, Michael, you picked a different one!"
Positive Activating,Just curious.
Personal advice,"I like your charts, but I would also get rid of the of the year numbers and go for color coded years instead, just to make it look less complicated."

Positive Activating,"While I do have some knowledge of Israel’s multiple-party system, your data story has made things much clearer."
"Complementing, expressing appreciation",This is amazing! It’s interactive and as an informative storyline backed up with very good data.
Unconventional emotion expression,I have not submitted an improvement as you have done and as such consider you more polite and productive than myself . : )
Asking questions,"I mean - is the age matter?You showed us that the number of users increased, do we really need to know it by ages?"
Asking questions,Did you have others questions arising while looking at the data ?
Negative Deactivating,So sad to see no rock artists in the top twenty
Positive Activating,Sankey diagrams always result in the most impressive-looking data visualizations.
Vocatives (addressing individual),Hi Felix

"Phatics, salutations and greetings, Social sharing",Good luck
"Complementing, expressing appreciation",I find your visualizations very impressive.
Expressing agreement,Agree with all your points.

Personal advice,I would be interested in the time course
Expressing agreement,"Hi Karoliina,I agree with your criticisms of the original graphic and the questions you raise about it."
Personal advice,You might also just show average growth rates of more and less urbanized areas.
Vocatives (addressing individual),"Hi Julian, very interesting subject, thank you!"
Personal advice,why not make the dots smaller and filled?
Asking questions,are there other coaches that we can compare them to?
Positive Activating,"I’m also curious why the dataset is missing the U.S., western Europe and much of the Middle East, areas that account for much of the world’s wealth."

"Complementing, expressing appreciation","Congratulations, your first graph is the greatest I have seen around here."
Quoting from others' messages & Referring explicitly to others' messages,"It would be a great opportunity to respond that questions, on base of UNFCCC historicals: https://unfccc.int/documents"

Unconventional emotion expression,You were ver throughout :)
Expressing agreement,"Yes, I agree...it took me a minute to figure out what was going on with the map, as well."

Positive Activating,Just wondering about a couple of things:

Personal advice,"Perhaps, in order to know whats states have the highest rates of gun violence"
Asking questions,Do you have some related data sources where we can further analyse?
Vocatives (addressing individual),Hi! Thanks for all the feedback Manoj!

Personal advice,That would be cool.
"Complementing, expressing appreciation","You also used the Kaggle site, which I recently discovered as a great data science tool."
Negative Activating,I think the header space is too easy to miss.
"Complementing, expressing appreciation","Hi Andrew,I think it is a very good solution that allows easy comparison between different categories and different countries, as well as the evolution of values over time."

Positive Activating,I love the idea of normalizing to the global average and showing how each country deviate.
Vocatives (addressing individual),"Hi Donna,Thank you for the feedback and suggestions, especially including the introduction/spread of treatment on the chart."

Personal advice,But here are my thoughts:- I would spell out once what ESL means .
"Complementing, expressing appreciation",Thank you for the feedback

"Complementing, expressing appreciation","Hi, Andrea --I’m glad you like the work I’ve done so far."
Personal advice,If you were to continue I would suggest making a research about arm sales and regions where they are more easy to get and explore what the links could be.
"Complementing, expressing appreciation","This is amazing, and such an inspiration for the rest of us!"
Personal advice,I think that particular component could be implemented more effectively
Quoting from others' messages & Referring explicitly to others' messages,also distracted by the gray text box overlapping the data.

Negative Deactivating,the templates are a bit limited
"Complementing, expressing appreciation","Mark, thanks for the suggestion!"
Expressing disagreement,I’m not sure if it’s a good idea.
Quoting from others' messages & Referring explicitly to others' messages,"although, as someone wrote it, I was"
Personal advice,One small suggestion: could you change the font colour of the label for each category to match the colour of the line? This might anchor the association between that value and the category it is linked to.
Negative Activating,"can’t figure out how to get rid of the country codes on the side, which is problematic b/c there are more countries than there is room for on the image."
Personal advice,Another idea would be to use the data to help people avoid bites in the future.
"Complementing, expressing appreciation","Hi Julian,Great Storytelling with your visualizations."
"Complementing, expressing appreciation",Nice analyse!
Positive Activating,I hope you are having a good week.

Quoting from others' messages & Referring explicitly to others' messages,Alberto Cairo also talked about him and he’s on the cover of his latest book.
Negative Activating,what to make of the Sankey diagrams
Negative Activating,.I wonder if it’s hard from me to compare everything because each illustration is not an apples to apples comparison.
Asking questions,"But if we were given a limited amount of space for the same visual, wouldn’t the removal of the map do better good than the absence of bar graphs/ other secondary aids?"
Negative Activating,I wonder if that could be investigated!
Negative Deactivating,"but the way this particular Flourish-template is set up the circle-colour is linked to the colour of the graph, which was then very hard to read."
Positive Activating,would be interesting to understand why.
Personal advice,"I think the interactive could be complemented with other graphics and variables to try to find a correlation such as education, poverty, number of guns by region..."
Personal advice,still maybe you give the happy floating bubbles a try?
"Complementing, expressing appreciation","Hi, Takura,Amazing and usefull visualization!"
Expressing agreement,I agree tha the solution will be to use a scatter diagram.

Personal advice,"Other things that come to mind are solo artist versus band member, geographic distribution, career trajectory to name a few.Please share the dataset you’ve compiled"
Unconventional emotion expression,but in my imagination dogs and mices are friends :)
Asking questions,Does cutting corporate taxes really creates jobs?
Positive Activating,chart and having just one scale for all data points.
Addresses or refers to the group using inclusive pronouns (addressing the whole group),"However, if this chart was adapted for Brazil, we would have to consider another variable - the unemployment rate, which would certainly help to justify the stay of the young people in their parents’ homes."
Personal advice,Could the text at the top be larger and summarized?

Unconventional emotion expression,Maybe that would also be worth exploring. :)
Negative Activating,Here I was also wondering if you could add the slope.
Asking questions,Might the increase in Medical Cards holders be due to the 2007 crisis?What about that huge cut in expenditures in 2009?What about the increase in GP card holders in 2014?
Asking questions,Just a question. What is the measure to calculate cheese production in 2015?

"Complementing, expressing appreciation",Your visualizations provide both a great overview and detailed information.Thank you for sharing this project.
Negative Activating,I’m confused without a title to each graph.
Asking questions,"One more thing I would check when exploring the data- are the numbers prior to 1989 taking the whole of the Soviet Union and then, after its collapse maybe its taking into account much smaller teritory and it can contribute to the decline in numbers?"
