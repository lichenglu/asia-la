Unconventional emotion expression,Feeling a bit ashamed now:)
Unconventional emotion expression,Nice one! :)
Unconventional emotion expression,Maybe that would work :)-- Emanuele.
Unconventional emotion expression,So many possibilities for further study!
Unconventional emotion expression,Colorful as the deserts. :-).
Unconventional emotion expression,"Amazing, did u use jupyter notebook(R or Python)? and pandas? and finally, git? I wonder! I can’t do that with jupyterR pandas!or just edit scrapping your code and write ms word? did u know the GPS key?"
Unconventional emotion expression,I have to go back to rewatch the videos to obtain some skills80% preparation???!!!
Unconventional emotion expression,You were ver throughout :)
Unconventional emotion expression,Wow!
Unconventional emotion expression,Maybe that would also be worth exploring. :)
Unconventional emotion expression,Probably the question I mostly have is how does your histogram look so much cleaner than mine :-).
Unconventional emotion expression,"Wow, Michael, you picked a different one!"
Unconventional emotion expression,Wow!
Unconventional emotion expression,They are too close to each other and they are not the right color for each category. But it needed a lot of work and I’m a lazy one ):
Unconventional emotion expression,"Well done, Esty:)"
Unconventional emotion expression,"I thought organizing the points by Cairo’s lecture would give my points more structure and meaning, almost like a ""text visualization"" ;-)."
Unconventional emotion expression,Greetings from your fellow Finn :)
Unconventional emotion expression,That’s a very interesting idea :)
Unconventional emotion expression,A different color/hue for the highest purchase is a good idea ;).
Unconventional emotion expression,Glad to see I wasn’t the only one with a lengthy list. :-)
Unconventional emotion expression,I have not submitted an improvement as you have done and as such consider you more polite and productive than myself . : )
Unconventional emotion expression,then map would’ve been the best idea. But it’s only my own vision and I don’t think that it is the only one right way to show the story :)
Unconventional emotion expression,But this is only my perception :)
Unconventional emotion expression,your solution is great!!
Unconventional emotion expression,"I didn’t do it for all the 20 countries as I mentioned in my post. It would take too much time :-), but that is the intent."
Unconventional emotion expression,More time needed for sure!:)
Unconventional emotion expression,Nice one Cris :)
Unconventional emotion expression,".So now I will, of course, probably ""borrow"" your idea (and lots of other ideas I see in these forums, too)! :-)"
Unconventional emotion expression,Forget to explain my reasons :) ::::
Unconventional emotion expression,"Still, I think it would be interesting to explore more the data about bicycle path use. :)"
Unconventional emotion expression,Or maybe you are sniper and consider a low mortality rate bad as it means too many wasted bullets? ;-)

Expressing disagreement,I don’t think Map chart can add any value for this life expectancy information.
Expressing disagreement,"To your point, maybe it’s not necessary because they all increased for every country...but - we might miss some key information where a country had a relativelylarge/small increase compared to the rest of the world, and the reader might need to know that to dig deeper and discover why."
Expressing disagreement,"I like the interactive and you can see that all the countries are making progress in increasing life expectancy. However if the purpose of the graphic is to highlight Singapore’s progress relative to other countries, it still doesn’t quite work."
Expressing disagreement,But in the point with the label inside the bars I think that can be more confused because in the graph have a lot of visual encoding and other inside other can be more heavy to understand.
Expressing disagreement,I would have to disagree that a map would be better because we are not trying to geolocate the counties.
Expressing disagreement,"Hi David, I understand your point, and I agree that the ""both"" display is not correct, but I still think that having the average can be interesting."
Expressing disagreement,I’m not sure if it’s a good idea.
Expressing disagreement,I don’t think this one graph does your topic justice.
Expressing disagreement,"However, I think they are all too many."
Expressing disagreement,"However, I think the map is important because it can show the geographic division, with the richer countries on the top left and the poorer on the lower right (except for Australia)."
Expressing disagreement,I didn’t think of using bubbles as I thought numbers were best represented linearly (by position?)
Expressing disagreement,"!However, there might be more correlationbetween income and BMI, butit is obscured through outliers (e.g. Polynesia, as you had pointed out)To make the correlation more visible, you may group countries by income size."
Expressing disagreement,I don’t think people who play the lottery would want to know that is pure hard statistics behind the drawing of the lottery balls!
Personal advice,"I like your charts, but I would also get rid of the of the year numbers and go for color coded years instead, just to make it look less complicated."
Personal advice,"Your suggestions would definitely make it easier to understand what the data are showing, but I do think that there will still be too much information to process."
Personal advice,"If this is really supposed to focus on Singapore, then it’s an extremely poor visualisation as now it’s not clear at all."
Personal advice,It would be good if the data could all be on the same chart.
Personal advice,Did you think about adding information regarding the source materials for the graph?! That is an important thing to add and note.
Personal advice,One small suggestion: could you change the font colour of the label for each category to match the colour of the line? This might anchor the association between that value and the category it is linked to.
Personal advice,"My suggestion for the first chart would be the line chart, which allows for a better comparison across continents over the years. In the second chart I think the information could be complemented using a map. So it looks visually beautiful, the information gets highlighted and the data does not get stuck to the table."
Personal advice,.It would also be interesting to see if location has anything to do with the earning of degrees.
Personal advice,"Hi Maseme,You should be proud of yourself."
Personal advice,"More beautiful, I think, when a simple graph, such as a curve, you can get important conclusions such as life expectancy or the treatment of a disease."
Personal advice,"It would be interesting to plot the introduction/spread of treatment on the chart, too, if that data were available."
Personal advice,"It would be great if you can analyzethelevel of education,where production is concentrated and so on."
Personal advice,Maybe you can bring in complementary data to see if there is a correlation between the amount of revenue a department brings in and how much its faculty is compensated?
Personal advice,"I didn’t think it added much, but now that you mention it, maybe should have added for comparison sake."
Personal advice,"Its is an interesting subject ,but the map don`t reflects the data clearly ,maybe the information should be presented in other format like a pie chart or bigger sections of the map."
Personal advice,"Hi Jim,I would suggest uploading your chart, that way the points you’re making will be much more convincing. It will also demonstrate your skills."
Personal advice,"I found a dataset in World Bank too about Health nutrition and population that might help you with the missing information, this is per country and maybe you can add a comparison in the countries you already have and not only information about HIV but also the nutrition the people who has it is getting: https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/dataset/health-nutrition-and-population-statistics-wealth-quintileRegards!"
Personal advice,Maybe you could add the graph or data you were exploring?
Personal advice,"Excellent taskSince the lack of parking can be a problem, maybe you can include that information, that is, look for the number of parking lots in the center and compare them with other sectors to find an answer."
Personal advice,"I would maybe suggest changing the hues of some sections so that there is less no confusion, for example the shading for recreation and clothing are somewhat close to each other."
Personal advice,May be you could split the in formation in a couple of graphics.
Personal advice,"For further analysis at that point, I suggest to look at governmentspends on public security yearly."
Expressing agreement,I definitely agree with a map as part of this visualization.
Expressing agreement,"Joy, you are right on by saying there is a lot going on with this piece."
Expressing agreement,I agree tha the solution will be to use a scatter diagram.
Expressing agreement,"Hi Aleksandra,I agree with all of your ideas."
Expressing agreement,"I’m not familiar with the Pareto chart, but I definitely agree representing as a life expectancy trend line chart would really highlight the trends better."
Expressing agreement,"Yeah I’m with you with the point of the color and the imagen about different sexs in the graphic, for me too this is should been different."
Expressing agreement,"If the purpose is to compare overall life expectancy by country, I agree ordering would be better."
Expressing agreement,If the purpose is to see the trends then I agree that adding another set of time plot graphs with the countries trends would help.
Expressing agreement,I most agree with your second critique regarding the country income breakdown.
Expressing agreement,"You are completely right with the imagen about different sexs and the color I think the same is better in the classic form, because is more easy to understand."
Expressing agreement,I agree with your point about not being clear on what constitutes
Expressing agreement,a high vs middle income economies.
Expressing agreement,I totally agree.
Expressing agreement,"I agree that the general purpose is both to show life expectancy improving over the past few decades and across economic classes, and the the chart does not achieve that."
Expressing agreement,I do agree that having one X and Y axis each and then grouping the data outcomes by country income is a good idea.
Expressing agreement,"I totally agree with you that before it’s possible to change this chart, the goal has to be clear."
Expressing agreement,"Agreed, I don’t think the map is particularly useful."
Expressing agreement,"Hi Arnold,I came to the same conclusion that small multiples was the ideal way to go."
Expressing agreement,I agree with you that a line chart would work much better heret han the stacked chart.
Expressing agreement,"I agree, there is nothing in the graphic itself that tells the viewer or reader that the focus of the chart is life expectancy in Singapore."
Expressing agreement,"I also believe the same, a horizontal bar chart would help to better understand this information."
Expressing agreement,"Yes, I do agree that there ought to be more than one chart to better explain and do comparisons."
Expressing agreement,I agree.
Expressing agreement,I agree I think it is confusing.
Expressing agreement,"Dear Camilla,You are right, ’life expectancy at birth’ is a complex term."
Expressing agreement,I agree with you on the different y-axis range for the different economies making it hard to compare all the countries.
Expressing agreement,I agree with you regarding confusion of the original chart and that not all the information should be displayed in one chart.
Expressing agreement,I certainly agree with the other commenter.
Expressing agreement,"Hello Mark,I agree with the problems you identify with this graphic."
Expressing agreement,"I just wanted to say that I agree with your insights, especially the one regarding the groups."
Expressing agreement,I agree with your suggestions.
Expressing agreement,I agree with your that the small multiple line charts is the best way to visualise the data.
Expressing agreement,I totally agree with you.
Expressing agreement,"Hello Tim, I agree with you, the ’both sexes’ looks like superfluous."
Expressing agreement,I agree with your assessment that the country comparisons are the most important.
Expressing agreement,I agree that having more data would be compelling.
Expressing agreement,"I agree that these rare ""extreme rain"" events are occurring much more often."
Expressing agreement,I agree that even simple graph can yield important conclusions.
Expressing agreement,"Hi Diana,I agree with your points."
Expressing agreement,I absolutely agree with stronger labeling.
Expressing agreement,I agree with Nancy that the US has probably already extended the life expectancy as far as they can with current technology and social education.
Expressing agreement,"Hi SharonYou are absolutely right about not being able to compare the pie charts, that’s why I made the column carts below."
Expressing agreement,I have to agree.
Expressing agreement,"Swathi,Given limited space, I think you are right that the bar graphs would be more important to keep than the map."
Expressing agreement,I agree that a stacked bar chart is ideal (this was my solution as well) but you should display the categories according to percentages rather than dollar amount.
Expressing agreement,I agree that a percentage conversion would do better good
Expressing agreement,I agree that the display of the numbers in a list in the box does not facilitate a better understanding or help compare expenditures to one another within or across countries.
Expressing agreement,I agree.
Expressing agreement,I agree with you on the lines.
Expressing agreement,"Yes, I agree...it took me a minute to figure out what was going on with the map, as well."
Expressing agreement,Agreed with you that the most interesting story hiding behind the numbers is that the highest spender countries spend most on recreation as compared to the lowest spender countries spend most on clothing.
Expressing agreement,"Hi Karoliina,I agree with your criticisms of the original graphic and the questions you raise about it."
Expressing agreement,"You raise a lot of good points, and I agree that the absolute values rather than percentages is the most important drawback. Percentages would clearly show that the patterns are very similar in the Nordic countries, and also quite similar in the rest of ""the Western world""."
Expressing agreement,"Yes, I agree!"
Expressing agreement,"Yes, I agree with you!"
Expressing agreement,I agree with you.
Expressing agreement,"Hello Pamela,I agreed with you about the use of bubbles for each country, it would be nice and also add some colors and gradients.You are totally right about the missing context."
Expressing agreement,"Hello Kat,I agreed with you, the map is unnecessaryfor the task they wanted to show."
Expressing agreement,"Hi Jan,I completely agree that converting to percentages spent on each category would give a better comparison and insight into the priorities and interest of different countries."
Expressing agreement,"Hi Jaime,I agree that the strings are somewhat distracting from the purpose of the map!"

"Phatics, salutations and greetings, Social sharing",Hi!
Positive Activating,I hope you are enjoying the course as much as I am!
Positive Activating,I like your suggestion of using a line graph to show changes
Positive Activating,over time.
Positive Activating,I love the idea of normalizing to the global average and showing how each country deviate.
Positive Activating,"I like your charts, but I would also get rid of the of the year numbers and go for color coded years instead, just to make it look less complicated."
Positive Activating,"It’s interesting that, like me, you were confused as to what was the overall purpose of the data viz."
Positive Activating,"Hi Julio,I like your suggestion of changing the orientation of the"
Positive Activating,chart and having just one scale for all data points.
Positive Activating,I like the layered 3-dimensional aspect of photo elements and data elements.
Positive Activating,Interesting ideas about engaging our five senses to synthesize a visualization.
Positive Activating,I hope you are having a good week.
Positive Activating,Your choice of x axis variable is interesting.
Positive Activating,I wish that I had incorporated that thought.I also liked your idea about the differences in scaling of economies -- there should be uniformity.
Positive Activating,"What I like about your chart, is that it well organized and it makes the"
Positive Activating,reader curious to know more about the facts and stories behind the data.
Positive Activating,"I really like how you have decided what you want to show (how life expectancy has improved in Singapore), what data you need to include (and what to exclude) to show it."
Positive Activating,"Your solution shows the data in a really interesting way, showing the clear correlation between income and life expectancy."
Positive Activating,I only wish I had produced a visualisation as effective as this!
Positive Activating,I think your design is very clean and I like that it shows Singapore is increasing it’s life expectancy more than a lot of other countries.
Positive Activating,I love your use of a line chart.
Positive Activating,Glad to know I was not the only one that struggled with the resolution of the graphic.A great note about the years.
Positive Activating,I really like your new graph.
Positive Activating,It’s a really interesting topic.
Positive Activating,The line chart was quite happy to show consumption over time and the map by enabling a view that generates comparisons between continents and countries.
Positive Activating,An interesting aspect to analyze is what’s the story with Paraguay (I believe is Paraguay the country painted with a softer blue in South America)...
Positive Activating,I would also be interested to see the number of women who go into these areas of study but do not earn their degree and how this compares to their male counterparts.
Positive Activating,I wish there was a way to give context to the numbers in regard to overall population trends.
Positive Activating,It is amazing to see your graphs and the sudden shift upwards since 2000.
Positive Activating,Silvio - I would be interested in seeing the correlation but the link did not work for me.
Positive Activating,"I was curious if you tried a quadratic trend for the relationship between parent education and percent of students meeting the requirement, since it looks as though it could be a curvilinear relationship."
Positive Activating,"Going off the last reply, another thing I’d be interested in is tenure."
Positive Activating,But I am curious why you chose to set the TV share in relation to the GDP?
Positive Activating,I’d be curious to know what the other two treatments are?
Positive Activating,i am curious about what other variables are included in your dataset.
Positive Activating,I am trying to learn tableau so I also really enjoy seeing how others are using the tool to create
Positive Activating,Looking forward to see what you find!
Positive Activating,"Parking downtown has always been considered a mess to locals, so I am curious how moving downtown shapes this."
Positive Activating,"You already have a great beginning to an interesting and important data journalism article, and I’m looking forward to learn more about these neighborhoods."
Positive Activating,I would be interested to see a screen shot of some of this data.
Positive Activating,"Thank you Daoud,Hope Alberto will talk about Tableau."
Positive Activating,I was very inspired to follow in your footsteps!
Positive Activating,"I really like your idea for a filter to cut down the distraction, although I am curious as to what that would look like or how that would play out, practically speaking?"
Positive Activating,"Hi Lauren, curious about why would you like to make it interactive if you would get rid of map."
Positive Activating,I hope my thought could help.
Positive Activating,Glad to see I wasn’t the only one with a lengthy list. :-)
Positive Activating,I’m surprised by how much the U.S. spends on arms imports.
Positive Activating,"Now I’m curious what we’re buying, and from whom.I’m also surprised by India topping the list, and almost doubling the amount spent by the runner-up."
Positive Activating,"With the new space force initiative, let’s hope the technology developed in that effort will be used for space exploration and development of products tobenefit humanity, not development of products to wage war fromspace."
Positive Activating,"I liked your idea, but I am curious about some lines."
Positive Activating,Hi Cristen - I enjoyed looking at your visualisation and think this is a really important issue.
Positive Activating,But I was very curious to know if there was any period when women’s wages exceeded that of men in any of the industries.
Positive Activating,"The question I’d be interested in answering is whether earnings increased or decreased over time for various industry groups--since it’s pretty clear from this visualization that pay generally increased over time for all groups, which clouds some of the gender-specific trends."
Positive Activating,Hope I have managed to explain my point.
Positive Activating,I enjoyed it and I’ve not seen a hockey game in 30 years.
Positive Activating,I was quite surprised to see that Russia had fewer first round picks and that the US had as many as it did.
Positive Activating,"I’m also curious why the dataset is missing the U.S., western Europe and much of the Middle East, areas that account for much of the world’s wealth."
Positive Activating,I hope you keep working with it!
Positive Activating,I hope you solve the mystery!
Positive Activating,I was curious to understand how you were going to show that a certain situation is a result of a certain factor.
Positive Activating,"I was very curious abour Ciclocidade’s source for the info used in your graphic’s, and the other graphics they have in their site, and they seem to rely heavily on specific daily bike counts in specific points of Brasil’s main cities, which makes me worry about biases in the base data."
Positive Activating,i was glad to see that the info was complemented with an awareness of aspects harder to portray in qualitative display of results.
Positive Activating,And I hope that works ok
Positive Activating,Hope this helps
Positive Activating,So I hope this was the right choice?
Positive Activating,I’m very curious to see how it would look like a graph that showed us the comparison between economic growth and inequalities.
Positive Activating,I hope you’ll find more data on this topic!
Positive Activating,I really enjoyed looking and learning about NYC 311 calls
Positive Activating,hope you can see the file now.
Negative Deactivating,Feeling a bit ashamed now:)
Negative Deactivating,I definitely disliked the gender stacking -- my suggestion/improvement included showing each gender separately in different graphs.
Negative Deactivating,"Unfortunately I could not find reliable figures for cancer disease in Africa to make a broader comparison, but I believe there are other aspects related to meat production, like chemicals usage, quality of water, etc, that may have an impact on cancer disease;"
Negative Deactivating,And so sad the same time.
Negative Deactivating,"The way the trend is on your chart, I am afraid this outlier value may eventually not be so far off the chart..."
Negative Deactivating,Unfortunately i am not able to read any of the annotations or the legend.
Negative Deactivating,"I was also confused by the content, and when looking at the graphic and not certain what story is being told."
Negative Deactivating,t’s a shame the available data doesn’t tell a more geographical storysomething along the lines of developing and emerging economies are mostly located in a band on either side of the equator.
Negative Deactivating,"Sorry for chiming in late, but also just wanted to mention, if we could look how the total amount of annual aid has an impact - because at first glance it seems that smaller countries may give more per capita because there is some minimal amount (that they may feel obliged to give, or had promised"
Negative Deactivating,"Sorry David, sent too soon! :)"
Negative Deactivating,"Unfortunately, due to resolution of your plot, I can not clearly see it on my screen..."
Negative Deactivating,"Unfortunately, the FFA does not indicate what the data relates to (paid for a performance, went to a performance)."
Negative Deactivating,"Sorry these are very brief/rushed comments, as I’ve already written up my comments to some other people (and run out of time)"
Negative Deactivating,I was a bit puzzled how the high numbers were much lower if the data set was limited to the time frame after the expansion of numbers occurred.
Negative Activating,"The charts are confusing, there are many bars."
Negative Activating,I agree I think it is confusing.
Negative Activating,"Wow, this graphicamazes. I wonder whythe chart has such peak in 2005, but before it in 2000 and earlier there was aplateau (decrease)?"
Negative Activating,"I wonder if it would be worthwhile to look at the two outliers more in depth? What is their gender & race, what sports teams do they coach, how long have they been employed at the school?"
Negative Activating,I’m also wondering: what kind of visualization would help factor in different costs of living?
Negative Activating,I find the first graph a bit confusing to visualize (maybe it’s the display in my screen).
Negative Activating,I was wondering - does your data set have time of day for the calls?
Negative Activating,"I wonder what would happen, if you set this data in relation to the GDP growth of the respective countries."
Negative Activating,I wonder where Ireland and Chad would wound up.
Negative Activating,I’m wondering if there was any change in the birth rate that could account for that dip.
Negative Activating,I am wondering why you limited your questioning to the US though as there are many other countries that have troops on the ground.
Negative Activating,I wonder if that could be investigated!
Negative Activating,This looks very random and is thus confusing.
Negative Activating,I also wondered why that was the case.
Negative Activating,I can’t really see it on the pic (although is nice draft!) and wonder how would you show it: as full and non-full boxes?
Negative Activating,"I wonder if this was moved into an interactive, online version if the tags could pop up when a user hovered over each country?"
Negative Activating,Got a bit confused now because I was later working with a lot of similar ones.
Negative Activating,"In that sense, I wonder now how much people of this 40% would be in a personal or family relationship with others who reached the British nationality status before and what would be their future in the country if it becomes a problem for getting a job, a renting house or medical assistance."
Negative Activating,I wonder if the improvement also has to do with globalization and the racers and coaches having to be more competitive?
Negative Activating,Here I was also wondering if you could add the slope.
Negative Activating,I wonder if there are changes in nationality around the Olympics and if those countries won?
Negative Activating,I wonder if it would be more informative to show the difference in the percentage of the population instead of the growth rate.
Negative Activating,"2007 is when the U.S stock market crashed, and I wonder if that reduced the amount of giving for some western nations."
Negative Activating,"I wonder if one were to look at the ’basket cases’ of Europe i.e. Ireland, Spain, and Greece who have seen crisis and austerity would the pattern across numerous social measurements be similar? Great stuff.tk"
Negative Activating,I wonder what conclusions we could draw (or what research could we instigate) if we focus on Panam and its spike in agrochemical use between 2013 and 2014
Negative Activating,I wonder what the data tells us about the income gap.
Negative Activating,.I wonder if it’s hard from me to compare everything because each illustration is not an apples to apples comparison.
Negative Activating,I wonder what could be the cause(s) of such a big difference?
