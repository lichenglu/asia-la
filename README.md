# Files Introduction

There are two notebooks in the project:

1. `word2csv.ipynb` - a util file to convert NVivo's MS Word output to csv files
2. `model.ipynb` - deep learning model

`model.json` is the model file converted from Keras by TensorflowJS

# Anything else

If you get inspired by this project and come up with other projects, it would be great if you can also open source those project when possible. We need more open conversation in the community of learning analytics.
